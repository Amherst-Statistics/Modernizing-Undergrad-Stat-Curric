# Industry Expectations for Statistics Graduates

by Hilary Parker, Stitch Fix

## Abstract

Stitch Fix is an ecommerce site that delivers personalized recommendations to customers, helping them discover what they love. Behind that effort are almost 80 data scientists from a large variety of backgrounds. As a team, we work on myriad problems which include optimizing our styling algorithm that acts as a first pass through our inventory, perfecting our stylist-facing interface for our unique "human in the loop" problem, analyzing changes to our site using A/B testing, and accurately modeling demand. In this talk, I will discuss the various roles on the team, as well as the foundational skills that can be taught to set students up for success.
