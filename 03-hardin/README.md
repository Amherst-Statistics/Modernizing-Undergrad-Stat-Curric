# Expectations and Skills for Undergraduate Students Doing Research in Statistics and Data Science

by Jo Hardin, Pomona College

## Abstract

As more statistics undergraduates participate in summer and capstone research projects, it becomes paramount for teachers to prepare them adequately for the experiences. Indeed, the most successful research students are those with both a strong understanding of foundational statistical methods as well as a fluent ability to wrangle data. In this talk, I will give some examples of undergraduate research projects and the skills necessary for students to be most successful.
