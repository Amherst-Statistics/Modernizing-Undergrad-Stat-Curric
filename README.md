10:35 AM	Modernizing the Undergraduate Statistics Curriculum — Nicholas J Horton, Amherst College

The ASA's 2014 guidelines for undergraduate programs in statistics stressed the importance of the integration of theory and practice to ensure that graduates have the capability to effectively extract meaning from data. Traditionally, an upper level course in mathematical statistics served to provide students with a theoretical foundation. Unfortunately, this course-often the last taken before graduation-did not reinforce aspects of computation and communication, nor could the theoretical foundations infuse later applied courses. While much has changed in our teaching of theory, further reconsider this curriculum is needed. In this talk, I will review the changing face of what many now call the "Theoretical Statistics" course, describe a variety of models that teach an integrated approach to theory and practice, share sample materials and activities, and propose learning outcomes for a variety of courses.

10:55 AM	Industry Expectations for Statistics Graduates — Hilary Parker, Stitch Fix

Stitch Fix is an ecommerce site that delivers personalized recommendations to customers, helping them discover what they love. Behind that effort are almost 80 data scientists from a large variety of backgrounds. As a team, we work on myriad problems which include optimizing our styling algorithm that acts as a first pass through our inventory, perfecting our stylist-facing interface for our unique "human in the loop" problem, analyzing changes to our site using A/B testing, and accurately modeling demand. In this talk, I will discuss the various roles on the team, as well as the foundational skills that can be taught to set students up for success.

11:15 AM	Expectations and Skills for Undergraduate Students Doing Research in Statistics and Data Science — Jo Hardin, Pomona College

As more statistics undergraduates participate in summer and capstone research projects, it becomes paramount for teachers to prepare them adequately for the experiences. Indeed, the most successful research students are those with both a strong understanding of foundational statistical methods as well as a fluent ability to wrangle data. In this talk, I will give some examples of undergraduate research projects and the skills necessary for students to be most successful.


11:35 AM	Moving Away from Ad Hoc Statistical Computing Education — Colin Rundel, Duke University Statistical Science

Modern statistics is fundamentally a computational discipline, but too often this fact is not reflected in our undergraduate curricula. With the rise of big data and data science it has become increasingly clear that students both want, expect, and need explicit training in this area of the discipline. To best achieve this we must be more purposeful in how we weave computational education throughout a curriculum with an eye towards consistency and the long terms skills we wish our graduates to have. In this talk we will discuss the specific efforts we have made at Duke Statistical Science to revise and update our undergraduate curriculum. In particular, we will discuss our overarching learning objectives for the major and we will provide specific examples from our revised and added courses.
